The Kalman Filter is an algorithm for estimating unobservable state variables using known state variables and measurement errors. 
When assuming noise follows a Gaussian distribution, the Kalman Filter provides the best parameter estimates based on measured data and previous parameters. 
In linear models, the Kalman Filter is the optimal estimation method.

In My code:
  I simulated 1E5 particles through 10 detectors and used the KalmanFilter to fit trajectories along the x-axis and scattering angles along the x-axis.
